# Privacy Policy for ReplyBoi

**Last updated: January 2, 2026**

## Overview

ReplyBoi is a Chrome extension that counts your replies on X (Twitter). Your privacy is important to us, and this extension is designed with privacy in mind.

## Data Collection

**ReplyBoi does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The only data stored by this extension is:
- A single number representing your reply count

This number is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage (`chrome.storage.local`) and is never sent to any external server.

## Data Usage

- The reply count is used solely to display your total replies on the extension icon
- No data is shared with third parties
- No analytics or tracking is implemented
- No personally identifiable information is accessed or stored

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **Host permissions for x.com and twitter.com**: Required to detect when you post a reply
- **Storage**: Required to save your reply count locally between browser sessions
- **Scripting**: Required to detect reply actions on the X/Twitter website

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device and nothing is transmitted externally, your data remains under your control at all times.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
